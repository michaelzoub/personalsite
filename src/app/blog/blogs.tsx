        description: `This is something I've been thinking a bit about recently. As technology develops exponentially, art progresses towards minimalism (sometimes with hidden meanings), in my opinion this is to counter all the noise new tech produces. This provides humans with an escape into an alternate reality or in other words a safe place. The tech space can be very exciting but sometimes draining. Maybe I have this opinion because of my presence in the tech world but I tend to find myself listening to songs with slow progressions, minimalistic but well made melodies and repetitive drum sequences. I also enjoy abstract art because it lets me experience things that reflect my life, it being simple lets us assign our own meaning to art.`
