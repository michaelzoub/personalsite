        description: `I just finished fixing a bug, it took me around 90 minutes. To be honest I was expecting it to be something out of my skillset, something new I had to learn. To resume, I was building a REST API for the first time on NextJS, I followed the docs and did everything accordingly until I started encountering errors. I started scanning all the files and desperately asking Claude AI if what I was doing was right or not (mind you I'm still a back-end baby). I then made sure I was using proper try & catch convention to give me a better chance at debugging. After running out of Anthropic credits and taking a small break, something lit up, I was so tunnel visioned that I had completely forgotten about the IDE terminal and was looking at the console for errors all along! My newbie self sighed and continued hacking away.`
